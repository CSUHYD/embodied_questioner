            "<Observation>\nIn the room, I observe a modern kitchen setup. To my left, there is a shelving unit with various items placed on it. A black stool is positioned near the shelving unit. In the center, there is a counter with a few objects, including a book, some fruits, and a small houseplant. To the right, there is a cabinet with a fridge integrated into it. Above the counter, there are cabinets with drawers. A window is visible in the background, allowing natural light to enter the room. A garbage can is also present near the fridge. The overall layout suggests a functional and organized kitchen space.\n</Observation>",
            "<Planning>\nTo find the Apple in the room, I will follow the determined search order: ['Cabinet', 'CounterTop', 'Fridge'].\n\n1. **Cabinet**: I will start by checking the cabinets, as they are a common place to store apples and other fruits. The cabinets in the image appear to be well-organized, so I will look inside each one systematically.\n\n2. **CounterTop**: Next, I will move to the countertop area. Apples are often placed on countertops for easy access and display. The countertop in the image has various items, including fruits, so this is a likely place to find the Apple.\n\n3. **Fridge**: Finally, I will check the fridge. While apples are not typically stored in the fridge, it is still a possibility, especially if someone is trying to keep them fresh. I will look inside the fridge to ensure no Apple is missed.\n\nBy following this order, I aim to efficiently locate the Apple in the room.\n</Planning>",

            "<Thinking>\nI am currently near the Cabinet, which is closed. Since my task is to find the Apple, I need to systematically search the room by checking different locations. Given that the Cabinet is a typical storage place for items, it makes sense to open it to check if the Apple is inside. The Cabinet is one of the first locations on my search list, so accessing its contents is a logical next step. Opening the Cabinet will allow me to inspect its interior and determine if the Apple is stored there.\n</Thinking>",
            "<Planning>\nTo proceed with my task, I will open the Cabinet. This will enable me to look inside and see if the Apple is located there. Once I have checked the Cabinet, I will move on to the next location on my search list, which is the CounterTop. The CounterTop is a common place to keep apples, especially if they are being prepared for use or display. After checking the Cabinet and the CounterTop, I will proceed to the Fridge to complete my search. By following this systematic approach, I aim to efficiently locate the Apple in the room.\n</Planning>",

            "<Reflection>\nI am in a kitchen environment, and the most recent action I took was opening the Cabinet to search for the Apple. Upon inspecting the Cabinet, I have concluded that it does not contain the Apple. The Cabinet appears to be empty or does not hold any items resembling an Apple. The kitchen setting is visible, with various elements such as the countertop, stove, and tiled walls. The next logical step in my search should be to move to a different location where an Apple might be stored or displayed. Given the typical layout of a kitchen, the CounterTop is a common place for fruits and other items, making it a reasonable next target for my search.\n</Reflection>",
            "<Planning>\nSince the Cabinet did not yield the Apple, I will now shift my focus to the CounterTop. The CounterTop is an area where apples are commonly placed for easy access or display. By moving to the CounterTop, I will continue my systematic search of the room. Once I have checked the CounterTop, I will evaluate whether the Apple is present there. If it is not found, I will proceed to the next logical location, which is the Fridge, as apples are sometimes stored there to keep them fresh. By following this structured approach, I aim to efficiently locate the Apple in the room.\n'/<Planning>",

            "<Reflection>\nThe current view shows a section of a kitchen with a focus on a cabinet area. The cabinet appears to be closed, and there are no visible signs of an Apple in this immediate vicinity. Given the previous actions, I have already checked the cabinet and determined that it does not contain the Apple. The countertop, visible in the image, is a likely place to find the Apple since it is a common area for placing fruits. The countertop in this image appears to have some items on it, which suggests it could be a good location to search next. The systematic search plan involves checking locations in a logical order, starting with the cabinet, then the countertop, and finally the fridge. Since the cabinet has been ruled out, the next logical step is to navigate to the countertop to continue the search. By moving to the countertop, I can inspect the area more closely and look for any signs of the Apple that might have been missed initially. This approach ensures a thorough and systematic search of the room.\n</Reflection>",

The apple is clearly visible on the left side of the countertop, indicating that the search for the Apple is successful. The systematic search approach has been effective, leading to the discovery of the Apple on the CounterTop as planned. With the Apple now located, the task is complete. The next steps, such as checking the Fridge, are unnecessary, as the goal has been achieved. The kitchen environment is well-lit, and the countertop provides a clear view of the objects, confirming the accuracy of the search.\\n</Thinking>"
